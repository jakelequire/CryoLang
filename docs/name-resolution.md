## 1. The root cause

Cryo resolves names in six independent subsystems that do not share an answer.
The roadmap (§2.1–§2.10) catalogues them. This section states why they exist,
because every rule below follows from it.

**Visibility in Cryo is a tie-breaker among collisions, not a gate.**

Measured 2026-08-03, by compiling a two-module program with the stage-2
compiler:

| Program | Result |
|---|---|
| Module `B` calls non-public `Helper::secret_fn()`, qualified | **compiles clean** |
| Module `B` imports `Helper`, calls `secret_fn()` bare | **compiles clean** |
| Module `B` references non-public `Helper::Secret` type | **compiles clean** |
| Two modules each declare non-public `secret_fn`, `B` calls it bare | **E0154 ambiguous** — and the diagnostic offers *both private functions* as candidates |

The mechanism is a single fast path in
`resolve_qualified_scoped` (`compiler/src/compiler/decl_index.cryo:1345`):

```cryo
const cands: SymbolStr[] = this.lookup_qualified_alternatives(bare);
if (cands.length == 0) { return ScopeResolution::NotFound; }
if (cands.length == 1) { return ScopeResolution::Unique(cands[0]); }  // <- no gate
```

`is_candidate_public` and `ns_imports` are consulted only in the
multi-candidate branch below it (`:1359-1360`). A name that is unique
program-wide therefore resolves from anywhere, regardless of visibility or
whether it was imported.

**Consequence.** Every declaration in the program is in every module's
effective namespace. "Which one did you mean?" then has no principled answer,
so each stage must guess; each guess is wrong in some case; each fix is another
heuristic. That is the fallback cascade, and it is why deleting fallbacks
without fixing visibility cannot hold — the ambiguity they paper over is real
as long as everything is visible.

This also explains three otherwise-unrelated observations in the roadmap:

- **§2.4** the global leaf index *is* the mechanism of global visibility.
- **§2.9** the FFI parallel namespace exists because "declaring the bare name
  would shadow same-named types in other modules" — a workaround for having no
  encapsulation boundary.
- **§2.4** the LSP declines a wire-side `Diagnostic` because "Cryo's resolver
  exposes a dependency's type names globally." That is this defect, reported
  from the outside.

**Rule 0, from which the rest follows: a name is resolvable only if it is
visible. Visibility is checked before resolution, not after a collision.**

---

## 2. Scope of this document

Defines: what a name means at a use site, which declarations are reachable,
how paths resolve, when ambiguity is an error, and what downstream stages may
assume.

Does **not** define: module discovery on disk (`module_loader.cryo` is
unchanged), mangling (`cryo-mangling-spec.md`), or trait selection semantics
beyond where its answer is recorded.

---

## 3. Visibility

### 3.1 Declarations

Every declaration has a visibility: `public` or (default) module-private.
`public` on an item means *other modules may name it*. It is not advisory.

### 3.2 The export set

A module's **export set** is exactly its `public` declarations. Nothing else
about a module is nameable from outside it. There is no path — index, alias,
fallback, or otherwise — by which a module-private declaration becomes
reachable from another module.

### 3.3 Enforcement is a gate

Visibility is checked **when a candidate is proposed**, not when candidates
collide. A single candidate that is not visible at the use site is
`Res::Err` with a diagnostic, never `Unique`.

> This is the single largest behavioral change in this spec. §8.1 records the
> measured blast radius.

---

## 4. Scope and the rib chain

A use site resolves a bare name against a **rib chain**, in this precedence
order:

```
  locals / generic params
    -> current-module items          (public AND private — a module sees itself)
    -> imported modules' export sets  (§3.2)
    -> prelude
```

Rules:

1. **Precedence is total.** An inner tier shadows an outer one silently; that
   is the point of the tier. A local shadowing an import is not a diagnostic.
2. **Ambiguity is reportable only *within* a tier.** Two imported modules both
   exporting `Foo` is ambiguous. An import shadowing the prelude is not.
3. **Prelude is the outermost rib, not a privileged tier.** "Imports shadow
   prelude" is a consequence of the ordering, not a rule anyone implements.
4. **Nothing is reachable that is not on the chain.** No global leaf index, no
   program-wide uniqueness, no namespace substring matching.

Rule 4 is what deletes the six lookup systems. Rules 1–3 are unchanged from
today's intended behavior.

---

## 5. Paths

### 5.1 Meaning

**The first segment resolves in scope; the remainder is rooted.**

The first segment resolves as a bare name through the rib chain (§4). Every
segment after it is resolved *within what the previous segment named*,
one segment at a time. `future::ready(...)` is legal exactly when `future` is
bound in scope, and then it means exactly one thing.

There is no substring matching, no suffix matching, and no dependence on what
other modules happen to exist in the program. A path that does not resolve is
an error with a suggestion, not an invitation to search.

### 5.2 One entry point

All path resolution goes through one function:

```
resolve_path(segments, ns, scope) -> Res
```

- **`ns` is a parameter**, not a separate code path. Type position and value
  position use the same function with a different `ns`. The §2.6 asymmetry —
  where bare `Range` resolved in annotation position but was E0154-ambiguous in
  call position on the same line — is unrepresentable after this.
- **`scope` is explicit.** There is no ambient cursor. This is load-bearing:
  the `home-module preference` step (`types/resolver.cryo:1387`, **26,473
  answers**, the largest single answering step in the cascade) exists solely to
  correct an ambient cursor pointing at the wrong module. With an explicit
  scope it has nothing to correct and is deleted, not fixed.

### 5.3 Type-relative paths

`T::Assoc`, `This::Item`, `Self::new` are **not** path resolution. The base
resolves via `resolve_path`; the remainder needs `T`'s bound and is finished in
sema (§6.2). `resolve_path` records the base `Res` plus a count of unresolved
trailing segments.

---

## 6. The two answers

Resolution produces two kinds of answer, recorded separately. Rust splits these
as `Res`/`PartialRes` vs `TypeckResults::type_dependent_defs`; Go as
`types.Info.Uses` vs `Selections`. Two independent implementations converged
here; it is not a stylistic choice.

### 6.1 `Res` — path to definition

Produced by the resolver, before types exist.

```
Res = Def(SymbolID)        // a resolved declaration
    | Local(...)           // a local binding
    | GenericParam(...)    // a type parameter, BY NAME
    | PrimTy(...)          // a primitive
    | Err                  // resolution failed; diagnostic ALREADY emitted
```

Two invariants:

- **`Res` names a definition, never an instantiation.** `T` resolves to
  `Res::GenericParam`, not to whatever `T` is bound to at some call site.
  Substitution happens strictly below `Res`, in the type layer. This is what
  makes `Res` safe for `ASTCloner` to copy verbatim, and it is the invariant
  whose absence forced `ASTCloner` to drop every `resolved_type`
  (`NamedAnnotation.pre_resolved` is a `TypeRef` — an instantiation — which is
  exactly the landmine this rule exists to prevent).
- **`Res::Err` is a value, not a failure.** It is produced once, with its
  diagnostic already emitted, and it poisons downstream without triggering
  re-lookup. **There is no state meaning "didn't resolve, try something else."**
  This is the single rule that would have prevented the cascade: most of the
  nine steps are error-recovery paths that were promoted to correctness paths.

### 6.2 `TypeDependentRes` — node to definition

Produced by sema, once the receiver type is known. Covers method calls, trait
selection, associated-item projection, and overload selection.

This **cannot** move into the resolver — dispatch needs the receiver's type.
Attempting it is what made an earlier revision of the roadmap's exit criterion
unreachable. `sema/call_resolver.cryo:1862` ("provided by multiple traits
implemented for this type") is permanently sema's, by design. Rust reports the
same condition from typeck (E0034), never from its resolver.

### 6.3 Storage

**The answer lives on the node.** A resolution slot on the AST node is exact
and cannot desynchronize. The current `ResolutionMap` is keyed by a packed span
— 32-bit file hash | 16-bit line | 16-bit col — and its own doc comment
(`resolver/resolution_map.cryo:31-38`) concedes that collisions silently
overwrite and that it is "best-effort … not a correctness gate."

Note precisely what the defect is: the **span key**, not the side table. A
node-identity-keyed side table would be exact. On-node storage is still the
better choice here — cheaper, and impossible to desynchronize — but a derived
span index rebuilt from node slots is legitimate for the LSP and dead-code
passes.

Path-bearing node kinds requiring a slot (inventory taken 2026-08-03):

| Node | Anchor |
|---|---|
| `IdentifierNode` | `AST/expression.cryo:104` |
| `ScopeResolutionNode` | `AST/expression.cryo:789` |
| `NamedAnnotation` | `AST/_module.cryo:456` |
| `NewExprNode` | `AST/expression.cryo:436` |
| `SizeofExprNode` / `AlignofExprNode` | `AST/expression.cryo:483`, `:506` |
| `CallExprNode` (callee) | `AST/expression.cryo:398` |
| `ImportDeclNode` (per segment) | `AST/declaration.cryo:575` |
| enum variant reference | `AST/expression.cryo:424` |

---

## 7. Enforcement

A specification that can only be honored by discipline will be violated under
deadline — that is the observed history of this subsystem. This section lists
what actually forces compliance, and is normative.

### 7.1 What the language can force — measured

Measured 2026-08-03 by compiling probe programs:

| Mechanism | Enforced? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exhaustive `match` over an enum | **YES** | `E0405`; `tests/negative/E0405_non_exhaustive_match.cryo` |
| Private struct/class **field** | **YES** | `E0353`; `tests/negative/E0353_private_field_access.cryo` |
| Non-public **function**, cross-module | **NO** | probe compiled clean |
| Non-public **type**, cross-module | **NO** | probe compiled clean |

**Cryo cannot currently enforce an API boundary.** Marking a function private
does not stop another module from calling it. Therefore:

> **Any design that relies on "make the fallback API private" does not work.
> The fallback entry points must be DELETED, not hidden.**

This is not a limitation to work around — §3.3 makes item visibility a real
gate, which fixes it. But the resolver's own enforcement cannot depend on the
feature it is implementing, so the mechanisms below are what carry it.

### 7.2 The four mechanisms

1. **`Res` is an enum, and `match` is exhaustive.** Adding or changing a
   variant forces every consumer to handle it (E0405). This is the primary
   compile-time lever and the reason `Res` is a sum type rather than a struct
   with sentinel fields.

2. **Deletion, not deprecation.** Every string-keyed entity lookup reachable
   from `sema`, `mono`, or `codegen` ceases to exist. A stage cannot re-derive
   what it has no function to call. Since visibility cannot wall these off
   (§7.1), non-existence is the only durable boundary.

3. **`B1 == 0` is a CI gate, permanently.** The `CRYO_RESOLVE_COUNTER`
   instrumentation is not scaffolding to be removed after Phase 4; it is the
   mechanism that keeps the property true. The cascade grew for years because
   nobody could see it growing — steps were added empirically and pruned only
   when someone noticed "0 hits across all builds." A gate converts "do not add
   fallbacks" from a principle into a build failure.

4. **An unstamped node is an ICE, never a fallback.** A path-bearing node that
   reaches a stage after `NameResolution` without a `Res` is an internal
   compiler error. Corollary, and the rule that keeps this from regrowing:
   **a pass that synthesizes a path-bearing node must construct it with its
   `Res` already set.** The synthesizer knows what it is referring to — it is
   creating the reference. Desugaring (`async_lower`, `?`), and `ASTCloner`
   are all bound by this. The same lesson was already learned once in the async
   work, where a synthesized call had to set its own `arg_binding`.

### 7.3 Buckets

The counter classifies every instrumented lookup into three buckets. The
two-bucket model in the roadmap (§3.2 rule 2) was measured wrong on
2026-08-03 and is superseded:

| Bucket | Meaning | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** | fuzzy fallback — guesses from a string | **zero** |
| **B2** | type-dependent — genuinely needs a receiver type | stays; enumerated and justified |
| **B3** | authoritative — answers from scope/imports | **once per path**, not zero |

B3 exists because `resolve_qualified_scoped` accounts for 487,838 of
`lookup_qualified_alternatives`' 496,945 calls, and it is import- and
prelude-aware — close to what §4 specifies. Classifying it as "must reach zero"
inflated B1 from 144,639 to 492,867 and set an unreachable target.
**"Must reach zero" is correct for fuzzy fallbacks and wrong for the
resolver's own lookup**, whose correct target is once-per-path.

Counter caveats, both load-bearing when reading any number it prints:

- Counters are **per-process**. Multiprocess codegen (≥16 modules) drops child
  tallies. A baseline run must pin `CRYO_CODEGEN_THREADS=1`.
- Sites **nest** (cascade step 5 ⊂ leaf-index hits). Totals are taken over a
  disjoint selection and count site events, not distinct resolutions.

---

## 8. Known gaps against this spec

### 8.1 Visibility is not enforced (§3.3)

The defect in §1. Turning the gate on will reject code that compiles today.

**Blast radius, measured 2026-08-03** (compiler building itself, via
`CRYO_VIS_AUDIT=1`, which logs every resolution that succeeded *only* because
the single-candidate fast path skipped the gate):

- 288,084 trips through the fast path
- **62,267 (21.6%) would be rejected** once gated
- those collapse to **1,131 distinct (use-site, candidate) pairs**

Classified by whether the use site's source file textually imports the
candidate's namespace (method: `scripts/`-style regex over `import` lines,
including brace lists; re-runnable):

| Class | Pairs | What it actually is |
|---|---:|---|
| Source **does** import it; `ns_imports` disagrees | **772 (68%)** | **Bug.** Brace-list imports (`import A::B::{ X, Y };`) do not register dependency edges for `A::B::X`. Dominated by `Compiler::AST::Expression`, `Compiler::Codegen::LLVMTypes`, `Compiler::AST::Declaration` — all brace-imported. |
| Implicit runtime dependency | **~318 (28%)** | **Omission.** `std::alloc::allocator` (157), `std::alloc::layout` (58), `std::core::ptr` (50), `std::collections::{hashmap,str,string}` (53). The compiler injects references to these for any heap type, f-string, or allocation. `seed_prelude_namespaces` (`decl_index.cryo:1245`) is a **hardcoded list of 12 namespaces** that omits every one of them. |
| Genuinely missing import | **~20 (2%)** | Add the import. |

**Reading: enforcing visibility is feasible**, but the second class is not what
it first appeared. See §8.1b.

### 8.1b Update after fixing class 1 (2026-08-03)

**Class 1 is fixed.** Brace-list import items are now scanned
(`module_loader.cryo`, `ModuleScanResult.import_items`) and recorded as
`ModuleInfo.imported_namespaces` — a **visibility** edge, deliberately not a
dependency edge, because `compute_order()` walks `dependencies` and an edge per
brace item recreates the false cycles the loader already avoids for
`public module`. `register_module_imports` now receives the union.

Re-measured:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| would-be-rejected events | 62,267 | **21,296** |
| distinct pairs | 1,131 | **397** |
| of those, ARTIFACT | 772 | **38** |
| of those, GENUINE | 359 | 359 |

**Class 2 is NOT a prelude gap — it is lost use-site attribution.** The
hardcoded `seed_prelude_namespaces` list turns out to mirror `stdlib/prelude.cryo`
exactly, so nothing is missing from it, and the prelude's own doc comment is
explicit that adding names has a cost. Two measurements identify the real
mechanism:

- A module whose entire content is `public function open_fn() -> i32 { return 1; }`
  — no types, no strings, no heap — still logs **64 violation events** against
  `NonNull`, `AllocError`, `GlobalAlloc`, `RawBuffer`, `String`, `Str`. It
  cannot be referencing any of them.
- Every use site blamed for `std::alloc::allocator` is a **consumer** (`CLI`,
  `Compiler::AST`, …). The stdlib module that actually owns the code never
  appears.

So generic/template bodies are being resolved **in the scope of the module that
instantiates them, not the module that wrote them**. `resolve_scoped`
(`compilation_context.cryo:386`) passes `current_module_ns()` — "the module
currently being processed" — an ambient cursor. This is the same root defect
as the `home-module preference` step (§8.2, 26,473 answers), which exists
purely to correct that cursor.

**Consequence for sequencing — this supersedes the ordering proposed before
the measurement.** The visibility gate cannot be turned on while template
bodies are re-resolved by name in a foreign scope; they would fail the gate for
names they never wrote. Fixing the cursor is not a prerequisite that can be
skipped or approximated with an allowlist — an allowlist here would be exactly
the "bandaid to get an easy green" this architecture exists to prevent.

Revised order:

1. ~~Brace-import visibility edges~~ — **done**, class 1 retired.
2. **`Res` on the node (§6.3) plus the explicit-scope rule (§5.2)**, so an
   instantiated body carries the resolution from where it was written and is
   never re-resolved in the consumer's scope. This is §3.2 rule 5 and §7.2
   mechanism 4 doing the work they were specified for.
3. Wire item visibility so it is actually recorded (see the caveat below).
4. Turn the gate on. The ~20 genuinely-missing imports are added here.

Two caveats on the classification: `is_candidate_public` **defaults to `true`
when visibility is unrecorded** (`decl_index.cryo:1319`), so the measured
"0 rejected for non-public" means *visibility is largely never recorded*, not
that everything is correctly public — item visibility must be wired before the
gate can distinguish the two. And the import classifier is a textual regex, so
"source imports it" does not prove the name legitimately comes from there.
Neither caveat changes the conclusion's direction.

### 8.1a A diagnostic counted but never rendered — FIXED 2026-08-03

Found while probing brace imports: a two-module program using
`import VisTest::{ Helper };` reported
`Project compilation failed (1 errors, 0 warnings)` and printed **no
diagnostic at all**. An error that cannot be read is worse than a crash.

Root cause was three separate defects stacked on one input:

1. **A self-dependency made the module graph unplaceable.**
   `import A::{ X };` records the parent path `A` as the dependency edge, so a
   file whose own namespace is `A` gained a self-edge and could never be
   placed. `add_dependency` now drops an edge to the module's own name: it
   carries no ordering information, and the brace items are recorded
   separately as visibility edges anyway.
2. **The cycle was reported only to the debug channel.** `compute_order()`
   printed the unplaced modules and their blockers via `cdebug`, so a plain
   build showed nothing. It now records `topo_unplaced`, and the caller names
   the modules in the cycle in the E0501 message (this closes §9 Q3's
   "needs a printed cycle path", though a full cycle *path* rather than a
   member list is still worth doing).
3. **The E0501 diagnostic was buffered but never flushed.** Diagnostics render
   on `flush()` (`diag/sink.cryo:111`); the `compute_order()` failure path
   returned without calling it. Notably the adjacent E0505 path
   (`instance.cryo:1442`) carries a comment saying exactly this — *"without
   this the buffered E0505 would never reach the terminal"* — so the bug class
   had been found and fixed at **one** site while this one was missed. Every
   `CompilationResult::failed` path in `compile_project` was audited; the
   others either print directly with `fmt::eprintln` (no buffered diagnostic)
   or sit after the flush at `:2497`.

A fourth defect surfaced from the fix and was also closed: brace-list items
were not being **discovered**, on the assumption that the parent's
`public module` manifest already had. False when the parent has no
`_module.cryo` — `import A::{ B };` then compiled without `B` while
`import A::B;` compiled with it. Two spellings, two meanings, which is the
same failure shape as §2.6. Brace items are now discovered exactly like plain
import paths.

### 8.2 Fallback inventory

Measured hit counts, compiler building itself, 2026-08-03:

| Fallback | Calls | Answers | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Global leaf index (cascade step 5) | 62,478 | **17,326** | 18% of all `resolve_named` answers |
| home-module preference (2c) | — | **26,473** | largest answering step; §5.2 deletes it |
| bootstrap arena (4, 4a) | — | 12,603 | deleted with `bootstrap_mode` |
| M1 `module_ns_matches_prefix` | 49,718 | 49,586 | 99.7% hit — load-bearing |
| M2 `resolve_module_qualified_symbol` | 28,748 | 22,516 | |
| M3 `collect_namespace_suffix_matches` | 5,669 | **0** | dead |
| M4 mono bare-name scan | 3,500 | **1** | effectively dead |
| M5 import suffix fallback | 456 | **456** | 100% — a missing capability, not a heuristic |
| cascade 3a / 3c (DI literal / bare) | — | 1 / **0** | dead |
| cascade 2b (E0203) | — | **0** | never fires |

### 8.2a The leaf index, attributed (2026-08-03) — one root cause under everything

Per-caller instrumentation of `lookup_by_leaf`'s six call sites, plus a
`CRYO_LEAF_AUDIT` log of every name it answered:

| Caller | Hits |
|---|---:|
| `resolve_named` step 5 | 17,084 |
| `sema/type_utils` leaf fallback | 6,438 |
| `type_resolution` base class | 17 |
| `resolve_named` generic bound | **0** |
| `symbolic_checker` generic bound | **0** |
| `type_resolution` generic bound | **0** |

**Three of six sites are dead** — every generic-bound lookup. Deletable with a
corpus entry pinning it.

The 17,084 collapse to **199 distinct (module, name) pairs / 165 names**:

| Name | Events | |
|---|---:|---|
| `GlobalAlloc` | 13,687 | **80% of the total** |
| `AllocError` | 898 | |
| `Formatter` | 825 | |
| `Option` | 461 | |
| `FmtError` | 258 | |
| … | | |
| **`ASTVisitor`** | **69** | **0.4% — the case §2.10a cites to justify the whole fallback** |

**14,588 of 17,084 (85%) were resolved with an EMPTY home module**, and
**39 of 57 `ResolutionContext::new(...)` sites pass `""`** as the home module.

**This is the single root cause under all three of today's measurements.** The
resolver is routinely called with no use-site scope. With no scope it cannot
answer from imports, so it falls the length of the cascade and lands on a
program-wide index — which is the only thing that *can* answer a question asked
without a scope. The same defect appears as:

- **17,084 leaf-index answers** — resolution with no scope at all (§8.2a)
- **327 visibility violations** — template bodies resolved in the *consumer's*
  scope rather than the definer's (§8.1b)
- **26,473 `home-module preference` answers** — a step that exists solely to
  correct the ambient cursor (§8.2)

**Consequence for D4 and Phase 2.** Legalizing intra-package import cycles
addresses `ASTVisitor` and its peers: **0.4%** of leaf-index usage. It does not
retire the fallback. What retires it is making the use-site scope mandatory and
explicit (§5.2) and stamping `Res` on nodes so synthesized and instantiated
bodies carry their resolution instead of being re-resolved scope-less (§6.3,
§7.2 mechanism 4). Those two changes are the keystone; nearly everything else
in §8.2 follows from them.

### 8.2b First scope fix landed (2026-08-03) — 87% of the leaf index retired

Two changes, both applying §5.2 ("resolve where it was written"):

1. **Default generic annotations resolve in the template's module.** A default
   (`struct String<A = GlobalAlloc>`) is syntax written in the template's
   module, so `expand_default_type_args` now sets `home_module` from
   `entry.module_name` on the context it already clones. Set in the shared
   layer rather than at the nine call sites: the owning module is a property of
   `entry`, so it is correct by construction and a new caller cannot forget it.
2. **Home-module resolution became import-aware.** Step 2c previously consulted
   only what the home module *declares* (`home_module::Name`). But a bare leaf
   in an annotation means what that module can *see* — its imports and the
   prelude. `GlobalAlloc` is declared in `std::alloc::allocator` and merely
   imported by `std::collections::string`, so the declaration-only check missed
   every time. It now falls through to `resolve_qualified_scoped_or` against
   the home namespace, which is import-scoped and therefore cannot bind to an
   unrelated same-leaf type in a module the home module never imported.

Measured effect on a full compiler build:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| `resolve_named` step 5 (leaf index) | 17,084 | **2,280** |
| `lookup_by_leaf` hits, all callers | 23,539 | **8,735** |
| `lookup_by_leaf` calls | 62,222 | 47,424 |
| step 2c (import-scoped home) | 26,473 | 48,764 |

Change 1 alone moved nothing (the declaration-only check still missed);
change 2 alone moved 2,503. Together they moved 14,804. **The two are only
useful in combination**, which is worth remembering before either is
"simplified" later.

This is the empirical confirmation of §8.2a: the global leaf index was
load-bearing because the resolver was being called without a scope, not
because of circular imports.

Note the visibility-gate reading rose (21,296 → 35,672) because more traffic
now flows through `resolve_qualified_scoped`'s unguarded single-candidate fast
path (§1). That is not a regression — those resolutions previously used a
program-wide first-writer-wins index with no scope at all — but it does mean
§1's fast path is now the dominant remaining source of scope-less binding.

Two readings matter for sequencing:

- **The leaf index answers far more than its documented justification.** The
  roadmap (§2.10a) justifies it as the only route for `ASTVisitor*` in AST node
  files. That cannot account for 17,326. Making intra-package import cycles
  legal will therefore **not**, on its own, retire it. A per-callsite
  breakdown of those 17,326 is required before that phase is scoped.
- **M5 hits 456 of 456.** It never fails, which means imports genuinely cannot
  express what the source needs today. It is a missing *capability*
  (per-item aliasing, re-export), and the capability must ship before the
  fallback is removed — otherwise it gets re-added under pressure.

### 8.3 B2 is unmeasured

Only the assoc-type projection (62) is instrumented. Sema's method and trait
dispatch — the actual bulk of type-dependent resolution — is not counted.
§7.3's B2 target is "enumerated and justified"; that is not currently possible.

## 9. Open questions

- **Q1** — Does enforcing §3.3 require per-item `public` on declarations that
  are currently bare, at a scale that makes the migration mechanical? Answered
  by §8.1's measurement.
- **Q2** — Does the FFI binding namespace (§2.9) become an ordinary module
  under §3.2, or does it need a distinct scope kind? It must get a principled
  home; a special case here regenerates heuristics.
- **Q3** — What is the diagnostic for a cross-package cycle, and its error
  code?
- **Q4** — Does `std::Range` survive? It works today only via the mechanism in
  §1. Either `stdlib/lib.cryo` re-exports it explicitly or it becomes an error
  with a suggestion — decided per name, deliberately.
